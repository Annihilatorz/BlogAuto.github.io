비 오는 날, 너무 힘들고 지쳐서 그만 멈추고 싶을 때가 있죠. 그렇게 고단한 순간에도, 작은 쉼표를 찍고 다시 일어서는 모습을 보여주는 것이 얼마나 대단한 일인지 생각해봐요. 비 맞는 곳에서 쉴 수 있는 이 순간, 조금 더 힘을 내고 나아갈 수 있게 해줘요. 🌧️💪

On rainy days, there are moments when I feel so tired and worn out that I just want to stop. But even in those tough moments, showing how I take a brief pause and then get back up again, that's something really remarkable. This moment of rest in the rain gives me the strength to push forward a little bit more. 🌧️💪

### Dalle Prompt

Imagine a scene in a soft and dreamy watercolor style, where a young girl, celebrated as a model and celebrity, takes a short rest amidst her run in a rain-drenched urban park in South Korea. Her outfit includes a waterproof jacket with a hood, marked by the word 'Tyri', and leggings, catering to her active lifestyle. Her blonde hair is swept under the hood, while she sports glasses to keep the rain at bay. This tranquil and serene image should reflect her exhaustion from the physical exertion, blending with the rain's gentle touch. The watercolor effect should enhance the dreaminess of the moment, making it an idyllic scene that would charm followers on a celebrity's Instagram with its soft, ethereal beauty and the visible resilience in the face of adverse weather.
