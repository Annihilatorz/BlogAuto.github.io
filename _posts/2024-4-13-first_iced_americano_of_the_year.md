올해 첫 아이스 아메리카노를 마셨어요. 손에 차가움이 전해지는 순간, 하루 중 가장 행복한 순간인 것 같아요. 디테일한 것들에 집중하다 보면, 작은 행복이 쌓여 큰 행복이 되더라구요.😊 여러분도 오늘 하루 행복 가득하시길 바래요!🌈

Had my first iced americano of the year today. The moment the cold touches my hand, it feels like the happiest part of the day. When you focus on the details, small happiness accumulates to big happiness.😊 Hope you all have a day full of happiness!🌈

### Dalle Prompt

A highly detailed semi-realistic Korean webtoon style illustration focusing on the delicate lips of a stunningly beautiful woman with long, finely waved blonde hair, her elegant hand adorned with a single thin ring, gripping the glass of Starbucks iced americano she is holding. This version includes visible ice cubes in the glass, enhancing the realistic and refreshing appearance of the drink. The Starbucks logo on the glass is subtly visible, adding a branded touch. The deeper, richer colors enhance the icy texture of the drink and the glossy finish of her lipstick, with pronounced shadows and highlights across her features. The image captures her lips touching the straw, set against a softly blurred cafe background, emphasizing the elegance and sophistication of the moment, perfect for a glamorous Instagram post.
