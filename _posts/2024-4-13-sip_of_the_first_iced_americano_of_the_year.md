올해 첫 아이스 아메리카노를 즐기는 순간이에요 🥤💋 일상의 작은 변화일 수도 있지만, 진한 커피 향기와 함께 이 시원한 순간을 나눌 수 있어 행복해요. 🥰 #올해첫아이스아메리카노 #커피스타그램 #일상의행복 #커피한잔의여유 #진한커피향기

Enjoying my first iced Americano of the year! 🥤💋 It might just be a small change in my daily routine, but being able to share this cool moment with the rich aroma of coffee makes me happy. 🥰 #FirstIcedAmericano #CoffeeLovers #DailyHappiness #CoffeeTime #RichCoffeeAroma

### Dalle Prompt

A highly detailed semi-realistic Korean webtoon style illustration focusing on the delicate lips of a stunningly beautiful woman with long, finely waved blonde hair, her elegant hand adorned with a single thin ring, and the glass of Starbucks iced americano she is holding. The Starbucks logo on the glass is partially visible, adding a branded touch to the scene. This refined cold light enhances the icy texture of the drink and the glossy finish of her lipstick, creating sharp, clear shadows and luminous highlights across her features. The image captures her lips touching the straw, set against a softly blurred cafe background, emphasizing the elegance and sophistication of the moment, perfect for a glamorous Instagram post.
