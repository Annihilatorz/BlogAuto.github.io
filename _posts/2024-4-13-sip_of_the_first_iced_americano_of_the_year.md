올해 첫 아이스 아메리카노를 즐기는 순간이에요 🥤💋 이 순간을 기록하려고 했는데, 예상보다 훨씬 더 아름답게 담긴 것 같아요. 멋진 커피의 향기와 함께, 이 시원한 순간을 나눌 수 있어 기뻐요. 그냥 일상의 작은 행복이지만, 이런 순간들이 모여 제게 큰 기쁨을 줘요. 여러분과 함께 나누고 싶은 순간이었어요. 🥰

Here's to the first iced americano of the year 🥤💋 I tried to capture this moment, and it turned out to be even more beautiful than I expected. I'm glad to share this cool moment with the wonderful scent of coffee. It's just a small happiness in everyday life, but these moments add up to bring me great joy. It was a moment I wanted to share with you all. 🥰

### Dalle Prompt

A highly detailed semi-realistic Korean webtoon style illustration focusing on the delicate lips of a stunningly beautiful woman with long, finely waved blonde hair, her elegant hand adorned with a single thin ring, and the glass of Starbucks iced americano she is holding. The Starbucks logo on the glass is partially visible, adding a branded touch to the scene. This refined cold light enhances the icy texture of the drink and the glossy finish of her lipstick, creating sharp, clear shadows and luminous highlights across her features. The image captures her lips touching the straw, set against a softly blurred cafe background, emphasizing the elegance and sophistication of the moment, perfect for a glamorous Instagram post.
