오늘은 음원 작업하는 날, 결국 모든 것은 수동으로 하게 되는 것 같아요. 😅 간단한 미디 작업은 할 수 있는데, 잘하는 분들을 보면 그저 감탄만 나와요. 🎹🎧 원하는 사운드를 찾아가는 과정, 그 자체가 어쩌면 즐거움일지도 몰라요. 💡💕 #뮤직스튜디오 #일상 #음악

Today is a music production day, and it seems like everything ends up being done manually. 😅 I can do some simple MIDI work, but when I see people who are good at it, I can only admire them. 🎹🎧 The process of finding the sound you want might be a joy in itself. 💡💕 #MusicStudio #DailyLife #Music

### Dalle Prompt

Redraw the scene in a detailed semi-realistic Korean webtoon style, now with a stronger emphasis on contrast and clearly defined shadows and highlights to enhance the sense of depth and dimension. Focus on an exceptionally beautiful woman with long blonde hair, wearing glasses and a headset, immersed in playing the keyboard. Her attire, a casual 'Tyri' t-shirt, is illuminated by a lighting setup that creates vivid contrasts, bringing her features and the studio environment into sharper relief. The warmth in the scene is preserved, but with more pronounced lighting effects, highlighting her serene elegance and the dynamic atmosphere of her modern studio, where she engages in the creative process of digital music production.
