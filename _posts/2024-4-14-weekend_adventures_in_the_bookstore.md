주말엔 설레는 서점 여행을 떠나곤 해요. 📚 저자들의 아이디어가 가득한 곳에서 새로운 시선을 발견하면서 휴식을 취하는 거죠. 이번 주말엔 마케팅 책들에 빠져보았어요! 💡🌱 아무래도 내일을 위한 작은 힌트를 찾는 거랄까요? 😊💛

I often embark on exciting journeys to the bookstore on weekends. 📚 It's a place full of authors' ideas, and a perfect spot to find fresh perspectives while resting. This weekend, I got lost in the world of marketing books! 💡🌱 Perhaps it's about finding little hints for tomorrow? 😊💛

### Dalle Prompt

A semi-realistic Korean webtoon style illustration of a young woman with long, wavy blonde hair, resembling the character in the provided image, in a commercial bookstore. The setting is dense with no background margins, showcasing book displays and wooden shelves filled with books for sale. The woman is comfortably reading a book, angled as if viewed from a tilted perspective, with casual yet fashionable clothing. Warm lighting envelops her and the bustling bookstore environment, all captured in a square format.
