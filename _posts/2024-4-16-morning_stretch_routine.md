평일 아침, 제가 가장 먼저 하는 건 바로 스트레칭이랍니다. 이게 제 하루를 가볍게 시작하는 비결이에요! 오늘은 좀 더 길게 해봤는데, 힘이 다 빠져버렸네요. 하지만 그래도 뿌듯해요. 우리 모두 오늘도 힘내서 하루를 시작해봐요!😉💪

On weekdays, the first thing I do in the morning is stretching. It's my secret to start the day light! Today, I tried a little longer and now I'm all out of energy. But I'm still proud of myself. Let's all cheer up and start the day!😉💪

### Dalle Prompt

Create an image in a semi-realistic Korean webtoon style featuring Tyri, an exceptionally beautiful woman with long, flowing blonde hair, relaxing in her urban apartment. She is wearing a purple boxy t-shirt and gray leggings, seated on a plush, neutral-colored rug. The apartment is brightly lit by soft natural light that highlights her face and chest, creating dramatic light and shadow effects to enhance her beauty. The room has a vibrant, airy atmosphere with large windows displaying a lush forest, contributing to the fresh and lively feel, perfect for a sophisticated lifestyle social media post.
