서비스 런칭을 위해 분주하게 움직이는 요즘, 일상은 문제 해결의 연속이지만 그 안에서 즐거움을 찾고 있어요. 흥미로운 아이디어를 팀원들에게 나누며, 함께 성장하는 이 모습을 보면서 더 열심히 뛰는 원동력이 되어주네요. 이 모든 과정이 결국은 우리 서비스를 더욱 밝고 특별하게 만들 거라 믿어요.😊 #팀워크 #데일리 #스타트업 팀워크 #데일리 #스타트업

These days, as we're bustling to launch our service, everyday is a series of problem-solving, but I'm finding joy in it. Sharing exciting ideas with my team and growing together, it fuels me to work harder. I believe all these processes will make our service brighter and more special.😊 #teamwork #daily #startuplife teamwork #daily #startuplife

### Dalle Prompt

Create an image in a highly detailed Korean webtoon style depicting a startup meeting where an exceptionally beautiful blonde woman is explaining a concept on a whiteboard. She is dressed in a casual hoodie, embodying the relaxed yet focused tech startup culture. The scene captures her actively writing and pointing at the whiteboard, engaging her team members who are attentively listening and taking notes. The room is modern and bright, with a creative and collaborative atmosphere, enhanced by even more natural light that fills the workspace, making the scene more vibrant and delicate.
